## OOP File Explorer
This project acts as a file explorer developed in Java and using OOP. It simulates a file system that is accessible via a web server integration and a UI. The application allows the user to navigate through a hierarchical folder structure and download .txt files.

## How does it work?
The backend acts as a server environment where files are stored.
The UI allows users to interact with folders and files via buttons.
Users can click on files to send a request to the server, whereupon the files are copied to a local directory.

##Functions
OOP Design: The code is organized using OOP principles, which ensures clean and maintainable code.
Web server: A simple HTTP server runs on localhost:8000 and processes file requests (GET).
UI: The UI, built with Java Swing, allows the user to navigate through the file explorer.
File Download: Users can download files from the server to their local system by clicking on the file button.
